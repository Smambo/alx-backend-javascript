### ES6 Classes <br>
<b>Classes</b> are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in [JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes.
